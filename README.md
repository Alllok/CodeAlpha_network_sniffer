Network Sniffer with PyQt5 and Scapy
This project implements a network packet sniffer using Python, PyQt5 for the graphical user interface (GUI), and Scapy for packet capturing. The tool captures network packets, displays key information about them, and allows users to export the captured data to a CSV file.

Features :- 
- Packet Sniffing: Captures network packets in real-time using Scapy.
- GUI for Interaction: Built with PyQt5, the application offers a user-friendly interface for viewing packet details.
- Packet Details: Displays information such as source and destination IP, protocol, packet length, and a summary of the packet.
- CSV Export: Allows users to export captured packet data to a CSV file for analysis or storage.
